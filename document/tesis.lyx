Maquinas de Soporte Vectoriales Transductivos (TSVM) han mostrado mejoras
 en tareas de clasificación donde las características presentan co-ocurrencia
 y los ejemplos de entrenamiento son pocos en comparación con los datos
 disponible como es común en problemas de categorización de textos (TC).
 Aunque la naturaleza del algoritmo de TSVM descrito por Joachims hace difícil
 que sea tan veloz como una SVM regular, la paralelización de este algoritmo
 es interesante cuando las ganancias en la efectividad de clasificación
 es crucial.
 Resolver el algoritmo de TSVM requiere la solución de múltiples problemas
 de programación cuadrática que generalmente escalan a 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n^{3})$
\end_inset

.
 Aquí describimos una implementación de un TSVM para problemas de clasificación
 binaria usando una arquitectura paralela que busca mejorar los tiempos
 de computo necesarios mientras preserva la efectividad de la clasificación.
 Para lograr este objetivo adaptamos la arquitectura en cascada desarrollada
 por Graf et al.
 para SVM regulares.
 La unión de estas estrategias produjo una implementación que es de 2 a
 7 veces mas rápida que una TSVM regular para un problema de TC de 2.000
 vectores y mas de 30.000 características.

Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align block
Transductive Support Vector Machines (TSVM) have shown improvements on classific
ation tasks such as Text Categorization (TC), where the features present
 co-occurrence and the training samples are few in comparison with the data
 available.
 Although the nature of the TSVM algorithm as described by Joachim makes
 it difficult to be as fast as a regular SVM, the parallelization of this
 algorithm is interesting when the gains in classification performance are
 crucial.
 Solving TSVM algorithm requires the solution of multiple quadratic programming
 problems that generally scales to 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n^{3})$
\end_inset

.
 We describe the implementation of a TSVM Solver for 2-class problem using
 a parallel architecture which aims to improve the necessary computation
 times while preserving the classification performance.
 For this purpose we adapt the parallel cascade architecture for regular
 SVM described by Graf et al.

We also experiment with an alternative heuristic for choice of the

 parameter for the TSVM problem

.
 This strategy produced an implementation that is 2x - 7x faster than a
 regular TSVM for a TC problem of 2,000 vectors and more than 30,000 features.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Text classification is a key aspect of text filtering, document management
 and retrieval tasks.
 Besides basic document classification for some kind of digital library,
 many problems can be seen as instances of the Text Categorization (TC)
 problem.
 Spam detection, Web search improvement and automated metadata generation
 are just a few examples of this
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Standard
of the tasks that can be accomplished using automatic techniques for document
 classification
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite

.
 
\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard
Add here the fact that the manual classification is at best expensive or
 impossible.
 Also add more examples of automated categorization usages
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Some of those tasks can be achieved by human beings, but a manual classificatio
n is at best expensive and practically impossible for large amounts of documents
 found today in modern information systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A TC technique uses example documents that have been previously categorized
 in classes by an authority in order to learn a model that, with an associated
 error value, can automatically predict the class that the authority would
 have given to future documents.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Support Vector Machines 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Vapnik98"

\end_inset

 are powerful tools for classifying large data sets, and due the nature
 of the classical text representation models, it has been applied successfully
 in automated document classification tasks 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Joachims98,Joachims99c"

\end_inset

.
 An special type of SVM, based on Transductive inference (TSVM), has demonstrate
d to be more effective for document classification than the common inductive
 inference based SVM 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Joachims99c"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One characteristic of the SVM is that, in its formal definition, the computation
 and memory storage requirements increase rapidly with the number of training
 vectors.
 This is due the fact that the SVM classification problem is a Quadratic
 Programming problem (QP) that finds the support vectors in all training
 data set.
 Solvers of this kind of problem generally scales to 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n^{3})$
\end_inset

 making it a very computationally expensive problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One approach to cope with this limitation is to divide the problem into
 chunks 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Joachims/99a,osunaetal97"

\end_inset

 and train those sub-problems.
 Even with these optimizations, the problem still has large computational
 requirements, and the required time to train grows sufficiently enough
 for making it not useful for real-time training when using large data sets.
 The implementation of Transductive inference for a SVM requires to solve
 the same problem many times over generally large data sets, until finding
 the optimal classifier.
 This makes the scaling problem for Transductive SVM even more difficult,
 therefore, methods for optimizing the training process need to be developed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taking advantage actual trends in processor technologies, where the multi-core
 processor is becoming the norm 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Marowka07,1069628|Geer05"

\end_inset

 parallel implementation of such algorithm along with other optimization
 will help make the application of this technique practical in real world
 situations.
 Also, as an extra motivation, empirical results have showed that some parallel
 settings for SVM have achieved better generalization than their classic
 counterparts for some problems 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite

In other words, the program learns from an experience commonly represented
 by a group of data belonging to a universe on which the result of Task
 
\begin_inset Formula $T$

 is known.
 Using this information the computer program tries to generalize for over
 the available data, thus learning a representation of the universe.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The way in which an actual computer program realizes the task of learning
 from the experience can different, there are several modes in which the
 learning task can be accomplished

\begin_layout Standard
In this thesis we are going to use a restricted definition in order to illustrat
e the concepts described above.
 In these pages machine learning will refer to a generalized regression
 characterizing a set of label events 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ (x_{1},y_{1}),(x_{2},y_{2}),...,(x_{n},y_{n})\right\} $
\end_inset

 with a function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi:X\rightarrow Y$
\end_inset

 from event to label.
 Many researchers have used this setting with success 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Berger2001"

\end_inset

.
 The reader will notice the similarity between this definition and the definitio
n of text categorization described in section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand vref
reference "sec:Text-Categorization"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The question of how good the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi$
\end_inset

 can generalize has spawned an entire subfield of machine learning called
 computational learning theory.
 Many of the techniques classified in this field have come from development
 of frameworks in this particular subfield.
 These frameworks generally don't state how good is going to perform an
 algorithm, instead create a probabilistic bound to the performance.

\begin_layout Standard
Machine learning algorithms are organized into a taxonomy, based on the
 desired outcome of the algorithm.
 Common algorithm types include:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* Supervised learning ? in which the algorithm generates a function that
 maps inputs to desired outputs.
 One standard formulation of the supervised learning task is the classification
 problem: the learner is required to learn (to approximate) the behavior
 of a function which maps a vector [X_1, X_2, 
\backslash
ldots X_N]
\backslash
, into one of several classes by looking at several input-output examples
 of the function.
 * Unsupervised learning ? which models a set of inputs: labeled examples
 are not available.
 * Semi-supervised learning ? which combines both labeled and unlabeled
 examples to generate an appropriate function or classifier.
 * Reinforcement learning ? in which the algorithm learns a policy of how
 to act given an observation of the world.
 Every action has some impact in the environment, and the environment provides
 feedback that guides the learning algorithm.
 * Transduction ? similar to supervised learning, but does not explicitly
 construct a function: instead, tries to predict new outputs based on training
 inputs, training outputs, and test inputs which are available while training.
 * Learning to learn ? in which the algorithm learns its own inductive bias
 based on previous experience.

Information storage and retrieval systems make large volumes of text accessible
 to people with information needs (van Rijsbergen, 1979; Salton and McGill,
 1983).
 A person approaches such a system with some idea of what they want to find
 out, and the goal of the system is to fulfill that need.
 The person (hereafter referred to as the user) provides an outline of their
 requirements?perhaps a list of keywords relating to the topic in question,
 or even an example document.
 The system searches its database for documents that are related to the
 user?s query, and presents those that are most relevant.
 General texts relating to information retrieval and computer implementation
 of retrieval systems are Salton (1988), Frakes (1992a), Baeza-Yates (1992),

\begin_layout Standard
Usually in a digital library database a set of words that defines the topics
 or the main characteristics of a document is manually defined.
 The main objective of this is to help the search of the physical document
 (e.g books, papers,etc.).
 This list of terms or keywords enables the user to query documents related
 to one or more concepts.
 One of the main problems of this is that only few keywords are associated
 with a defined document, and generally this assignation is made at hand,
 making it expensive and error prone.
 Generally this querying these systems was limited to the numbers of keywords
 assigned and some metadata like title, author and dates of publication,
 being the user unable to query the whole document, making the retrieval
 task significantly harder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nowadays in digital libraries and similar systems where the all the text
 is available in digital form, automatic keyword extraction makes sense
 because these keywords are tightly associated with the content.
 This keywords are called indexes and the task of associating each document
 with a set of keywords is called 
\emph on
indexing
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indexing is based is predefined group of keywords: the dictionary or vocabulary.
 As mentioned above, in a digitalized text database (also called a corpus)
 the dictionary is usually extracted from the set of words present in the
 corpus, and the expensive manual indexing can be avoided by representing
 the documents by the dictionary terms they are made of.
 Given that all the full text is available for querying it, now problem
 is to find the best way of representing the text in order to extract the
 more important words, that is, the keywords that define it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the last few decades many representation forms have been developed
 ranging from simple word appearance binary representation to a concept

 was defined proposed by Salton and Buckley

\end_inset

 and it is the more complex of the three.
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $tf_{j}(d)$
\end_inset

 (term frequency) is the number of times that the 
\begin_inset Formula $j^{th}$
\end_inset

 word appears in the document 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $df_{j}$
\end_inset

 is the number of documents the term appears in all the corpus and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the total number of documents in the corpus.
 The main reason behind this formulation is that in the context of document
 retrieval it is considered that words appearing too frequently across the
 corpus may not be discriminant, therefore this formula gives more importance
 to terms appearing more frequently in the documents while penalizing the
 ones that appears in to many documents.
 The reader may have noticed that this representation of text does not take
 into account the actual order of the words inside the document, despite
 this, vector space model have performed well and it still used with some
 variations in the majority of IR systems.

In this model, each document d is represented as a vector (1, ..., M), where
 j is a function of the frequency in d of the jth word wj of a chosen dictionary
 of size M.
 Note that the VSM does not take into account the order of the words in
 the document.
 For that reason it is often referred to as bag-of-words representation.
 The simplest choice for the weights .
 corresponds to the binary indexing, where: j = ( 1 if the word wj appears
 in d, 0 otherwise 8j 2 {1, .

 The more complex term frequency inverse document frequency (TFIDF) weighting
 scheme was proposed by Salton and Buckley (1988) in the context of document
 retrieval where it is considered that words appearing too frequently across
 the corpus may not be discriminant.
 In its standard form it is defined by the following formula:

approaches for feature selection, others than the design of a stop-list
 and the stemming of words.
 These approaches attempt to select from the original vocabulary V, the
 sub-set V0 of terms (with V0 V) that, when used for document representation,
 provides the best results.
 As stated in Sebastiani (2002), the choice of this subset is generally
 done by a filtering approach, that is selecting the terms that reach the
 highest scores according to a function that measures the “importance” of
 each term for the task.
 This function can simply be the document frequency (Yang and Pedersen,
 1997; Dumais et al., 1998), or a more complex information-theoretic function
 such as information gain (Yang and Pedersen, 1997; Yang and Liu, 1999)
 , mutual information (Yang and Pedersen, 1997; Dumais et al., 1998), chi-square
 (Schutze et al., 1995; Yang and Pedersen, 1997; Yang and Liu, 1999), etc.
 Nevertheless, Joachims (1998) shows that the performance of a system trained
 without the “best” features according to mutual information criterion are
 still better than a random system.
 This result proves that even the “worst” features still contain discriminant
 information, and thus suggest that all features should be selected, when
 possible.

the vector space model representation described above may seem simplistic
 in comparison with the more complex representation mentioned first, nevertheles

Due to the fact that the representation of the text can have impact in any
 retrieval task, any strategy to enhance the representation of text should
 be studied.
 With the years, many techniques have been developed in the field of Information
 Retrieval in order to get a better performance on the representation of
 the text made.
 IR research shows us that the word stems work well as representation units
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Joachims98"

\end_inset

.
 The word stemming process (sometimes called term conflation) consists in
 removing the case and flection information from a word 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

.
 For example words as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

engine

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

engineer
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

engineering
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 becomes the same term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

engin
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Generally this techniques are applied to the document before the transforming
 it into a term vector representation, thus making the resulting document
 vector notably smaller.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another technique used to avoid unnecessary large feature vectors is removed
 the so-called stop-words, or the words that for their common use is known
 that are not significant for the text.
 Words like

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of text categorization (TC) is to automatically assign, for each
 documents, categories selected among a predefined set.
 In opposition to the machine learning typical multi-class classification
 task which aims at attributing one class among the possible ones to each
 example, documents in a text categorization task may belong to several
 categories.
 Sebastiani 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Sebastiani02"

\end_inset

 formally defines TC as task of assigning a Boolean to each pair 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle d_{j},c_{j}\right\rangle \in\mathcal{D}\,\, x\,\mathcal{\, C}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}$
\end_inset

 is a domain of documents and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}=\{c_{1},\ldots,c_{|c|}\}$
\end_inset

 is a set of predefined categories.
 a true value assigned to the pair 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle d_{j},c_{j}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 indicates the decision of filling 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{j}$
\end_inset

 under category 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{j}$
\end_inset

, and a false value the decision of not filling it under that category.
 More formally the task is to approximate a unknown target function 
\begin_inset Formula $\breve{\Phi}:\mathcal{D}\,\, x\,\mathcal{\, C}\rightarrow\{T,F\}$
\end_inset

 using 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi:\mathcal{D}\,\, x\,\mathcal{\, C}\rightarrow\{T,F\}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\breve{\Phi}$

\begin_inset Quotes eld

coincide as much as possible

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A text categorization task can be performed in many ways, for instance one
 might want to classify a document in just one category (single label case
 or not overlapping categories) or from 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $|\mathcal{C}|$
\end_inset

 categories (multilabel case or overlapping categories).
 A special case of single label TC is the binary TC in which each 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{j}$
\end_inset

 is assigned to category 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

 or its complement 
\begin_inset Formula $\widetilde{c}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to perceive the multilabel case as different problem but
 one can express the multilabeled TC task for a set of categories 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}=\{c_{1},\ldots,c_{k}\}$
\end_inset

 as a group of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 binary case problems, this requires that categories be stochastic independent
 or each other although some recent development in structured classification
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Tsochantaridis/etal/05a"

\end_inset

 might be useful to tackle multilabel interdependent TC task.
 In this work we are going to deal with binary categorization tasks because
 as stated by Sebastiani 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Sebastiani02"

\end_inset

 many important TC applications are in fact binary categorization problems
 and moreover, as described above we can solve multilabel TC as many binary
 TC task assuming independent categories, which is a valid assumption for
 most of the problems.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TC heavily relies on the models that have been developed for IR.
 the reason of this is that TC is a content based document management task,
 and such it shares many characteristics with other IR tasks such as text
 search, specifically IR-style indexing using one of the models mentioned
 in 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Models-of-Text"

\end_inset

 and the evaluation of effectiveness of the classifier using the measures
 described below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Performance Measures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One question that arises after reading the definition of TC is how to measure
 the how well the classifier function
\begin_inset Formula $\breve{\Phi}$
\end_inset

 (the approximation or hypothesis) matches the unknown target function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi$
\end_inset

 (effectiveness).
 This is generally measured in terms of the classic IR metrics of precision
 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and recall 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 but adapted to the specific case of TC.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is defined as the probability that if a given a random document 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{x}$
\end_inset

 is classified under the category 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

 the classification is correct (
\begin_inset Formula $P(\breve{\Phi}(d_{x},c_{i})=T\,\,|\,\, P(\Phi(d_{x},c_{i})=T)$
\end_inset

).
 Analogously 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is defined as the probability that if a random document 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{x}$
\end_inset

 is ought to be classified under 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

, this decision is taken (
\begin_inset Formula $P(\Phi(d_{x},c_{i})=T\,\,|\,\, P(\breve{\Phi}(d_{x},c_{i})=T)$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In binary TC, with we can express the concepts of precision and recall mathemati
cally using the numbers of true positive (
\begin_inset Formula $TP$
\end_inset

), false positive (
\begin_inset Formula $FP$
\end_inset

), true negative (
\begin_inset Formula $TN$
\end_inset

) and false negative (
\begin_inset Formula $TN$
\end_inset

) documents classified.
 The true of false value means that the classification was performed correctly
 or not, and the positive or negative define whether it belonged to the
 evaluated category or not.
 Using these definitions we can write precision 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and recall 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
P=\frac{TP}{TP+FP} & ,\, & R=\frac{TP}{TP+FN}\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For multilabel classification this only would be local measures for a single
 category c, in that case the local measures are averaged using different
 methods such as 
\emph on
microaveraging 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
macroaveraging
\emph default
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The values of precision and recall for TC vary in an inverse relation, for
 that reason many articles about TC uses break-even point of 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Joachims98,DumaisPHS98,Lewis_et_al_2004"

\end_inset

 which generally implies to modify in some degree the hypothesis.
 Another approach is to use the 
\begin_inset Formula $F1$
\end_inset

 measure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "citeulike:543360,Manevitz_et_al2002,112471"

\end_inset

 which combines both precision and recall and is defined as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
F1=\frac{2RP}{P+R}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $F1$
\end_inset

, like 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is bounded by 1 and the best results under this measure are the higher
 values.

\begin_layout Subsection
Applications of Automated Text Categorization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can think that the application of TC are somewhat limited to automated
 document classification but many problems can be seen as special instances
 of TC, Sebastini 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Sebastiani02"

\end_inset

 list some of them:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Document Organization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe the first application that comes to the mind when thinking in TC.
 Indexing with a controlled vocabulary is an instance of this problem that
 can be solved with TC techniques.
 Also any kind of document organization and filing such personal information
 or enterprise data organization can be viewed as instances of this problem.
 For example one can think in newspaper ads and the categories in which
 they should be classified, this is generally done at hand but can be addressed
 with many of the existing TC techniques.
 Other applications includes automatic patent classification, automatic
 news classification under topic sections (e.g Politics, Lifestyles, Sports,
 etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Text Filtering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Text filtering is the activity of classifying a stream of incoming documents
 dispatched in an asynchronous way by an information producer to an information
 consumer 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Sebastiani02"

\end_inset

, for example a newsfeed where the producer is the news agency and the consumer
 is the producer is the newspaper or a RSS feed where the producer is the
 website and the consumer the individual users that syndicate the feed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Automated Metadata Extraction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In digital libraries, one is usually interested in tagging documents by
 metadata that describes them under a variety of aspects (e.g., creation date,
 document type or format, availability, etc.).
 Some of this metadata is thematic, that is, its role is to describe the
 semantics of the document by means of bibliographic codes, key words or
 key phrases.
 The generation of this metadata may thus be viewed as a problem of document
 indexing with controlled dictionary, and thus tackled by means of TC techniques.

\begin_layout Subsection
Machine Learning Text Categorization Techniques
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The construction of Text Classifiers using an inductive approach have been
 tackled using different strategies, we are going to mention some of the
 most popular approaches included the technique that we will use through
 the rest of the text.
 There are two ways of classify a item in a category, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

hard
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (automated) way which is basically a binary approach and the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

soft
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 o ranking (semi automated).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A ranking classifier is generally accomplished defining a function 
\begin_inset Formula $CSV_{i}\,:\, D\rightarrow[0,1]$
\end_inset

 that, given a document 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{j}$
\end_inset

returns a categorization status value for the 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

 category (how much the classier believes that the document belong to that
 category) whereas the hard approach only accepts or reject a document under
 a defined category.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Probabilistic Classifiers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The probabilistic based text classifiers are very popular, they see the
 
\begin_inset Formula $CSV_{i}(d_{j})$
\end_inset

 in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $P(c_{i}|d_{j})$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, the probability that a document represented by vector 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{j}=(w_{1j,}w_{2j},\ldots,w_{|M|j})$
\end_inset

 (that can be binary or weighted as mentioned in section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Models-of-Text"

\end_inset

) belongs 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

 and computes this probability by application of the Bayes theorem.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Decision Trees Classifiers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Probabilistic classifier are quantitative, that is, numeric in nature.
 This kind of methods are often criticized since, effective as they may
 be, they are no easily interpretable by humans.
 Symbolic (non-numeric) techniques no suffer of this problem.
 In this category decision trees learning is one of the most important example.
 A decision tree (DT) text classifier 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Mitchell97,Sebastiani02"

\end_inset

 is a tree in which internal nodes are labeled by terms, branches departing
 from them are labeled by tests on the weight that the term has in the test
 document, and leaf are labeled by categories.
 This kind of classifier categorizes a test document 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{j}$
\end_inset

 by recursively testing for the weights that the terms labeling internal
 nodes have in vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{d_{j}}$
\end_inset

 , until a leaf node is reached.
 the label of this node is then assigned to 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{j}$
\end_inset

.

Support Vector Machine (SVM) method has been introduced in TC by Joachims

 and has been user by others in their experiments with good results 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite

 Basically SVM tries to find among all the surfaces

\end_inset

 in a

-dimensional space that separate the positive from the negative training
 examples (decision surface).
 This is done by finding the decision surface with the widest margin of
 separation.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With all these precedents the following question arises: how take advantage
 of this trend and use all the parallel computing power of new processor
 for solving machine learning problems? We are in the beginning of the multicore
 era and there is no easy answer to this question, mostly because there
 is not even an unified general approach to take advantage of this architecture,
 although some basic strategies can be described.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic approach is to run the same algorithm with different parameters
 on different processors.
 Cluster software like Open Mosix, Condor might be used in this situation.
 As noticed by Langford, this particular approach does not speed up the
 run of a particular machine learning algorithm.
 Other approaches includes the decomposition of the algorithm into statistical
 queries 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 and parallelize the queries over the the samples, for example using map-reduce
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite

 The last and most difficult way is to develop fine-grained parallelism,
 which is the way brain actually works.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have discussed the evident speed gain using parallel methods for running
 but the question whether the a parallel algorithm fine-grained parallelize
 implementation can achieve better performance is still unanswered.
 Another question that arises is if there are methods that not necessarily

 and still harness parallel architectures.

 In this case we are gonna simplifier the setting by stating that 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$
\end_inset

 can only take two values 
\begin_inset Formula $\{+1,-1\}$
\end_inset

 for the positive and negative classification case respectively.
 This is case of a binary classification problem, for a multiclass classificatio
n problem, we can transform it into different binary classification ones.
 We also assume that the class represented by 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}=\{+1,-1\}$
\end_inset

 are linearly separable.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As described above, the complexity of the classifier should be minimized
 in order to achieve a good generalization, for linear classifier this equivalen
t lowering that complexity is to maximize the margin of separation between
 the points and the hyperplane.
 An approach to find this separator is to maximize the margin between two
 parallel supporting planes, if we define the margin as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
 & w^{T}x+b=\,\,\,1\\
 & w^{T}x+b=-1\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the margin of separation is equal then to 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=\frac{2}{w}$
\end_inset

 .
 Now our problem becomes maximize 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{2}{w}$
\end_inset

 which is equivalent to minimize 
\begin_inset Formula $||w||_{2}/2$
\end_inset

 in the following quadratic programming problem:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
 & \underset{w,b}{min} & \frac{1}{2}||w||^{2}\nonumber \\
s.t &  & y_{i}(w^{T}x_{i}+b)\geq1\label{eq:min0.5w2}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Condition 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}(w^{T}x_{i}+b)\geq1$
\end_inset

 specify that all the data points have to be classified correctly.
 In order to solve this problem we introduce the Lagrangian formulation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar \-

\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
\,\underset{\alpha}{max}\,\underset{w,b}{min}\,\, J(w,b,\alpha) & = & \frac{1}{2}w^{T}w-\sum_{i=1}^{N}\alpha_{i}[y_{i}(w^{T}x_{i}+b)-1]\label{eq:lagrangian}\\

 are given by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Which is a quadratic programming problem (QP).
 Notice that the dual problem is cast entirely in terms of the training
 data.
 The fact that this is a QP problem is one of the strength of this methodology
 and also a weakness.
 It's a strength because as opposed to others techniques such as Neural
 Networks, the optimization problem is convex and a global optimum is always
 reached in a finite amount of time 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite

 On the other hand, a QP is a computationally expensive problem, this property

Many times a linear separator is not enough to classify the data properly,
 geometrically speaking, a more complex surface is needed in order to separate
 the data correctly.

 on separability 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite

 in order to accomplish this, SVM uses the so called

 for more information on this method.
 The dual for formulation using this approach is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
min\, Q(\alpha) & = & \sum_{i=1}^{N}\alpha-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}\alpha_{i}\alpha_{j}d_{i}d_{j}K(x_{i},x_{j})\nonumber \\

 the TC task using SVM can bee seen geometrically as finding an hyperplane

 Each point is a vector representation of a document which can be done using
 any of the models described back in section

 As argued by Joachims 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Joachims98"

\end_inset

, SVMs offer two important advantages for TC:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Doing term selection is generally not needed, because SVM are robust to
 overfitting problems and can scale up to high dimensions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
No human and machine effort in parameter tuning on a validation set is needed,
 as there is a theoretical default choice of parameter settings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These two characteristics makes the SVMs attractive for tackling this kind
 of problems.
 In real life scenarios, TC problems involves high dimensional data and
 large amount of computing processing.
 As mentioned before, the fact that SVM need a lot of calculation power
 for training makes it an important motivation for using a parallel algorithm
 when training SVM.

Transductive Learning for SVM

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far with the formulations described in the last section we are using
 what is called inductive learning, in other words we start from a set of
 examples, and based on them we try to find a classificator function that
 classifies correctly the data.
 This is called Inference learning, that is, going from particular examples
 to a general hypothesis.
 The Transductive setting on the other hand, tries to use the known distribution
 of the test data in order produce a classifier.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This setting has a clear application when we don’t care about the particular
 function; we only need to classify a given set of examples (i.e test set)
 with as few errors as possible.
 The Transductive inference uses the training examples previously labeled
 and the unclassified examples to generate an optimal partition and labeling
 of the unclassified examples, using the prior knowledge provided by the
 distribution of the unclassified examples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the TSVM or Transductive learner is to select a function 
\begin_inset Formula $hL=L(S_{train},S_{test})$
\end_inset

 from the hypothesis space 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 using 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{train}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{test}$
\end_inset

 such that the expected number of erroneous predictions on the test and
 the training samples is minimized.
 But, why not use the learning rule obtained by means of the training examples
 to classify the test examples? The problem arises when a small training
 set is use.
 The classifier will have a “poor” generalization due to the lack of knowledge
 about the distribution of points in the space 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "EspinosaJ2003"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The classifier function estimated with very few points will lead to disappointin
g results.
 Unlike of the inductive setting, the Transductive setting uses the location
 of the test examples when defining the structure.
 Such structure corresponds to a structure of possible hypothesis solution.
 Using prior knowledge about the nature of testing data provides extra informati
on to built an appropriate structure.
 The structure is build based on the margin on both the training and the
 test data.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solving the Transductive SVM using the algorithm described by Joachims implies
 solve many times an SVM inductive optimization problem.
 The algorithm improves the objective function by switching the labels interacti
vely of two unlabeled data points 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{i}+\xi_{j}>2$
\end_inset

.
 It uses two nested loops to optimize a TSVM which solves a quadratic programmin
g every time it changes a label from an unlabeled data.
 The convergence of the nested loop relies in the fact that there is only
 a finite number 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{U}$
\end_inset

 ways of labeling of 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 unlabeled points and it is unlikely that all of them are examined 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "1248609"

\end_inset

.
 However because the heuristic only swaps the label of two unlabeled examples
 at each nested loop iteration it might need (and in fact it does) many
 iterations to reach a minimum which makes it intractable for big data sets
 in practice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TSVM in the worst case have complexity of 
\begin_inset Formula $O(L+U)^{3}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 labeled points, although it generally scales to square in most practical
 cases 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Joachims/99a"

\end_inset

 thus still intractable for large data sets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to optimize this kind problem one can try to modify the formulation,
 for instance example solving it in the primal rather than in the dual with
 an alternate technique although the question of how widely applicable are
 these methods are remains to bee seen.
 or use any of the general approaches described in section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Paralell-Machine-Learning"

\end_inset

 that makes use of the computation power given by the new multicore processors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the specific case of SVM and TSVM one could try to modify the problem
 in a way that makes it easily parallelizable 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "1248601"

\end_inset

 Generally this is accomplished through the use of decomposition technique
 of some kind.
 Another approach is to use a mixture of SVM 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "citeulike:935557|Collobert2002"

\end_inset

 in order to to train each of them with a subset and them using the mixture
 of expert approach 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Jacobs:Jordan:Nowlan:Hinton91"

\end_inset

 which is easily parallelizable.
 All these approach modify in some manner the original formulation of the
 problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A recent approach called the Cascade SVM consist in an array of SVM solvers
 arranged in pyramid form.
 This structure allows an easy parallelization and does not modify the original
 formulation at all 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "GrafCBDV04,ZhangZY05"

\end_inset

.
 This is the approach selected for the parallelization of TSVM because there
 is no need to modify the original quadratic programming problem and is
 straightforward to implement.
 Some small modifications are needed in order to be fully adapted to the
 Transductive algorithm described by Joachims.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Cascade SVM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Cascade SVM was described by Graf et al 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "GrafCBDV04"

\end_inset

 and further explored by Zhang et al 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "ZhangZY05"

\end_inset

 and is based in the strategy of early elimination of non-support vectors
 from the training set 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Joachims/99a"

\end_inset

.
 The Cascade SVM is a distributed architecture where smaller optimization
 problems are solved independently making them easily parallelizable.
 The results of this smaller problems are then assembled in a way that is
 ensured that it eventually converges to globally optimal solution.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to find a minimum using this approach the problem is initialized
 with a number of independent smaller optimization whose results are combined
 in later stages in a hierarchical fashion as shown in figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:svm-cascade"

\end_inset

.
 The data is split into subsets and everyone of them is evaluated for to
 find support vectors in the first layer, then the results are combined
 two-by-two and entered as training set for the next layer.
 Often a single pass through the cascade produces satisfactory results and
 if it is not the case, that is, if solution is not the global maximum,
 the result of the last layer is fed back into the first layer, where each
 of the SVM of the first layer receives all the support vectors and test
 them with fraction of his inputs to check if any of them have to be incorporate
d into the optimization.
 If this is not the case for all SVM of the input layer, the cascade have
 converged otherwise it proceeds with another pass through the network.
 The formal proof of the convergence can be found in 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "GrafCBDV04"

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Cascade Transductive SVM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original formulation for this cascade SVM is defined for the classical
 SVM problem so it is necessary to adapt the architecture described above
 in order to handle properly the TSVM formulation.
 There are at least two approach for this, the first approach is to make
 each of theSVM in the array Transductive, using the algorithm described
 in Figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:alg-tsvm"

\end_inset

.
 Even if this might seem obvious ultimatly the loop in each of the SVM will
 be run in just one processor so the only possible speed up would be in
 terms of the number of training and testing data available.
 Also splitting and mergin the subsets might need additional modifications,
 despite this fact, it might be interesting to vizualise the behaviour of
 this approach and for that reason is left as a future work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other approach is parallelize the more computational expensive part
 of the TSVM algorithm: the 
\emph on
solve_svm_qp
\emph default
 function which solves the dual problem associated with formulation described
 in section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Transductive-Learning-for"

\end_inset

.
 Now for each iteration of the loop the a SVM inductive problem is solved
 in a parallel manner.
 We have two goals to achieve with this, in the first place we need to implement
 an algorithm that is at least is as good as the serial (non parallel) version
 and also we need to ensure a speed up of the process through the use of
 the parallel architecture.

One thing that should be noted is the error values handling.
 As the reader can see in 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:alg-tsvm"

\end_inset

 the decision whether to swap the values of the labels for each uncategorized
 data depends on the error of the classification of that particular value
 but as in each layer we eliminate them in the process, we have to keep
 a record of the classification error of the eliminated unlabeled vector
 because we are going to use in the decision of the second loop.

As we can see the data set is divided by newsgroup topics and can be grouped
 into similar categories.
 For the experiments we define two tasks, an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

easy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 one and an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hard
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 one.
 For the easy task we took 1000 messages from 
\emph on
alt.atheism 
\emph default
and 1000 messages from 
\emph on
comp.graphics
\emph default
.
 We call this an easy task because the terms that appear in the documents
 from each collection are different, so we can expect a nearly separable
 problem.
 The hard task we chose related news groups were is expected that the most
 important terms similar for both collection.
 We chose c
\emph on
omp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
comp.sys.mac.hardware 
\emph default
for evaluating the SVM effectiveness and computation times with also 1000
 messages from each of them.
 The data was split in a training set (20%) and testing or ulabeled set
 (80%).
 The unlabeled set for the TSVM was used as the testing set for the classic
 SVM.
 We also made some test with fewer training data but with the same amount
 of test data in order to visualize better the goods of transductive inference
 when only few training data is available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As performance measure we chose 
\begin_inset Formula $F1$
\end_inset

 as measure of effectiveness, we also show the values of precision and recall
 for the experiments.
 The kernel choice for the SVM was the linear kernel which has been reported
 to be effective for text categorization tasks 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Joachims99c,DumaisPHS98"

\end_inset

, thanks in part to the high dimensional nature of the input vectors.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 parameter was estimated for the two sets using 5-fold cross validation
 with the training set.
 The other parameter defined by Joachim's algorithm is 
\begin_inset Formula $num+$
\end_inset

, the number of test inputs to be labeled initially as positive, in our
 implementation this number is also half of the total test set, thus ensuring
 the precision and recall break-even.
 The choice of the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $C*$
\end_inset

is done using many heuristics, however we use the one proposed by Joachims
 which consists in making it equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.
 This parameter is of great importance for the computation time of the overall
 algorithm because the annealing used by Joachim's algorithm, for that reason
 we wanted to improve the computation time by choosing the right C* parameter
 so we tested the implementation effectiveness with the original Joachim's
 heuristic 
\begin_inset Formula $C=C*$

Besides the categorization performance, we are interested in the computation
 time, we expect that with the appropriate formulation of the parallel architect

Toy Experiment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the objective of prove the methods and their performance, a test with
 few training and test samples was carried out first, the number of features
 is also less than the full problem formulation because only a fraction
 of these were preprocessed for this initial test.
 For this toy experiments the hard task was performed with 200 testing messages,
 100 from c
\emph on
omp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware 
\emph default
labeled positive and 100 from 
\emph on
comp.sys.mac.hardware 
\emph default
labeled negative.
 The training set consisted also of 200 messages with the same characteristics.
 In these experiments (Table 
\begin_inset LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Toy-Experiment:-comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware"

\end_inset

) the number of training samples varies for each test so we can appreciate
 the difference in the performance of the methods.
 T stand for number of training samples and S for number of testing samples.
 We can appreciate that transduction algorithm perform much better than
 inductive when few training samples, a very attractive characteristic for
 many real problems.
 Even when the number of training samples is equal to the number of testing
 samples the transductive outperforms the inductive algorithm for the F
 measure.

\begin_layout Standard
We can notice how the classical SVM algorithm is always faster that the
 Transductive implementation and for this specific problem, which is expected
 to be almost linear separable, with few unlabeled data the classification
 performance is very similar, while the difference in speed of the algorithm
 is really huge.
 However when the training data decreases and more there is more unlabeled
 data the differences in classification performance begin to be more noticeable,
 even with this

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 problem.
 Regarding the speed, is obvious by the results that that the standard SVC
 algorithm is by far faster than its transductive counterparts, therefore
 we are going to discuss the differences between the transductive and its
 parallel version.
 For this problem, the classification performance of the transductive algorithms
 were the same, thus one of the objectives was accomplished, to maintain
 the same classification performance while performing the tasks in parallel.
 Of course, the gains of the parallel approach and the early eliminations
 of non-support vectors are devised in the time used for the calculations
 on the Transductive SVM problem.
 One thing that can be noticed in the tables is that the parallel version
 of the algorithm no necessarily is slower when facing much more data, this
 is due to the process of early elimination of non-support vector and it
 may happen that with much more data more non-support vectors are eliminated
 in proportion with the amount of unlabeled data, making the whole process
 faster.
 This particular property can be really appealing when working with larger
 datasets, of course it will depend entirely on the dataset.

As expected, the TSVM performed better than the classic linear SVM, however
 due to the nature of the data, the classification performance difference
 between the two the TSVM and the SVM was not really substantial.
 Another thing to notice is that this example is somewhat counter-intuitive,
 because you could expect that for more training data available the difference
 between the classification performance between the classical and the transducti
ve SVM would increase.
 However the opposite happened, when more training data was available, the
 difference between their performance decreased.
 Another result of the experiment, that surprised us but we knew it could
 happen was the for the 100-200 setup the transductive parallel SVM had
 a little bit more classification performance than the non-parallel version.
 Even with this particularities in general terms the expected occurred,
 the classification performance of the transductive setting was higher than
 the inductive one, and the parallel version of the TSVM run almost 3 times
 faster than the non transductive one.

In this work we have implemented a parallel version of TSVM as described
 by Joachims' 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite
key "Joachims99c"

\end_inset

, an approach that because its annealing heuristics requires many iterations
 solving a similar problems.
 Our approach, in order to speed up the process, was to parallelize the
 SVM solver function using a Cascade architecture.
 We have shown that this approach speed up the process 2 to 7 times using
 just one dual core processor.
 This architecture scales very well, therefore is expected that, with more
 processors available the the speed gains will be even more noticeable.
 In addition, more layers in basic architecture could help in the improvement
 of the computation time.

From the data tables one could argue that the classification performance
 gains for using TSVM does not worth the computation time spent even with
 this parallel approach.
 However this last statement is in someway subjective, as the trade-off
 between speed and classification performance depends in nature of the problem,
 it would be possible that we would prefer more classification performance
 at cost of computation time.
 Also, if more and more processors/cores available (as it is the actual
 trend) the speed gains could be much more noticeable.

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding the classification performance of the TSVM algorithm we noticed
 something particular, the best C for the C* for the transductive setting
 does not generally match in the sense that the best C parameter for the
 inductive problem does not produce the best classification performance
 in the transductive problem for the given set of data.
 However, we have chosen the parameter that works best for the inductive
 setting.

\begin_layout Standard
However it is truth that more optimization strategies have to be developed
 in order to make this algorithm really usable in real world situation.
 Now, with a parallel and scalable version of the transductive algorithm
 a series of strategies could be explored in order to further optimize the
 computation time, however the implementation of such strategies is outside
 the scope of this work and are mentioned here as a possible future work.

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe the most obvious approach is that given that the data is split in
 equal parts (subsets), and per each iteration only one of the parts is
 modified (i the labels of two of the entries) there is not need recalculate
 the other parts of the n and they can be reused.
 For example in our particular case, we calculated 7 distinct SVM problems
 (as our architecture o 3 layers t in 4-2-1 e respectively), using caching
 we wold only need to calculate all of them once at the r and then only
 when a pair of of vector fell of different SVM problem.
 For the most of the iterations we would only need to calculate 3 problems.

\begin_layout Standard
Another strategy would be try new improved heuristics as described by Collobert
 et al 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 and modifying in Joachims' TSVM by reducing iteration in the cycles or
 interchanging more labels per iteration.
 This last is important because the annealing heuristic used by Joachim's
 TSVM is source of the elevated computation time.

\begin_layout Standard
A good thing about this approach is that any improvement to the SVM formulation
 can be directly applied to the SVM, for example the technique of Zanghirati
 et al.
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

could be applied to each one of the SVM solvers in order to have multilevel
 parallelization, further improving the computation performance.
