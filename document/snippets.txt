With the surge in digital text media, text classification has become increasingly important.
Text classification techniques can assist in junk e-mail detection [SDHH98], allow
medical doctors to more rapidly find relevant research [HBLH94], aid in patent searches
[Lar99], improve web searches [CD00], and serve as a backend in a multitude of other
applications. The interested reader should see Sebastiani [Seb02] for a survey of recent
applications of machine learning to text classification.

[DHS01, Wol95]indicate there is no a priori choice of algorithm
which will perform the best over all problems,

Need for Paralellization:

- Transductive Learning requires to solve the same problem many times!
- There actual trends in Computer Processor are multi-core architetures, allowing and encoraging to
  create parallel solutions to standard problems.
