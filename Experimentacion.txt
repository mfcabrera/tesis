Performance Measures

	recall = Number of items of category correctly identified / Number of category members in test set
	precision = Number of items of category correctly identified / Total items assigned to category (Correct and Incorrect)



		Precisition and Recall 


Many evaluation criteria for classification have been proposed. 
The most popular measures are based on precision and recall. Precision is the proportion of items
placed in the category that are really in the category, and Recall is the proportion of items in the category that are
actually placed in the category. We report the average of precision and recall (the so-called breakeven point) for
comparability to earlier results in text classification. 
In addition, we plot precision as a function of recall in order to understand the relationship among methods at different
points along this curve. Table 2 summarizes microaveraged break even performance for the 5 different learning algorithms for the 10 most frequent categories as
well as the overall score for all 118 categories.
